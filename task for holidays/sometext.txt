There are many ways that reading helps you to learn English, but reading
itself is an important life skill. In everyday life we use reading to get 
information about the world around us. There are signs on the street. 
Can you park your car here? Which days can you park? How long? There are 
letters from school or utility companies that come in the mail. There are 
also bus schedules, bills, medicine labels, ads, health care pamphlets, and 
technical manuals for our electronic devices. When you are new to a country, 
this is the first kind of reading you need. USA Learns will help prepare you 
with the Life Skills reading activities.
